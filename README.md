# `@eropple/exit-codes` #
I am not, by trade, a heckin' cool, plaid-wearing black-rimmed-glassesman of a NodeJS
developer†. I spend a lot of my time toiling in the bowels of the computer universe and so
I have a certain appreciation--nay, _fondness_--for doing things in a way that the older,
wiser, and oh god have you seen a C program lately-er code running underneath _my_ code
can comprehend.

Then I couldn't find an exit codes package for NodeJS (whether due to my own incompetence)
or its fundamental nonexistence) and, I tell you this with absolutely no exaggeration
whatsoever: a literal exclamation point sprouted from the top of my head as if I was a
mook about to get my neck broke in a _Metal Gear Solid_ video game auteured by one Mr.
Hideo Kojima.

So I broke out a Ruby interpreter to YOLO out some TypeScript, breaking laws in at least
seven jurisdictions I have personally been to in my life, and the results are what lie
before you.

## Installation ##
I trust that you know how to install a package named `@eropple/exit-codes` with your package
manager of choice. I apologize for the scoped name; NPM in their infinite wisdom (have you
set your stuff on fire today, guys?) decided that `exit-codes` is not an acceptable name
when `exit-code` exists.

I trust you will be gratified by stomping my name into your codebase. You're welcome.

## Usage ##
`import` the package. Pass its sweet, sweet constants to `process.exit()`. Be smug
about your correct UNIXing. Or Linuxing, should you be integrating with systemd.

While this is Open Source and Free Software and so I cannot _demand_ your smugness,
I can but humbly request it.

† - At this moment I am wearing plaid, but am not wearing black-rimmed glasses because
yesterday my [monstrously strong but very peaceable dog](https://i.imgur.com/o5Fa8iQ.jpg),
in his excitement at the idea of An Treat, delivered unto the temple of my head a headbutt
strong enough to snap an acetate frame. I was not even angry. I could only compliment him.
And pet his head, for he was very concerned that I was missing a part of my face.
